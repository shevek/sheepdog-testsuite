This is a sheepdog stress tester. It issues multiple create, delete,
read and write requests to VDIs on a given set of target hosts.

0) Log into a system which can ssh to all your computenodes.
	For example, labX-shell

1) Run the following:
	java -jar app/sheeptester-app.jar \
		--host 10.144.11.103 \
		--host 10.144.11.116

2) If your collie is not on the path, add:
	--collie <path-to-collie>

3) To tune the behaviour of the tester, use --reads, --writes,
	--threads and --loop

BEHAVIOUR:

Parallelism is limited by the number of threads. A work queue is
used internally.

0) All VDIs are created using the work queue.

1) When all VDIs are created, all writes, then all reads are queued
into the work queue.

2) When all I/O operations are completed, the next iteration
commences issuing reads and writes via the queue.

3) When all I/O iterations are complete, all VDIs are deleted.

CAVEATS:

Finding sheep runs and parses netstat on the target system. The
process MUST be able to sudo without a password to run netstat.

You cannot use more threads per host than the MaxSessions parameter
in your sshd_config on the server. This is 10 by default.

If a VDI already exists, then the system will generate offset errors
from collie, as it assumes that all VDIs have the sizes it (attempted
to) create
